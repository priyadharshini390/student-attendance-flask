# student-attendance-flask
A web-based college portal developed using Python Flask and HTML for managing student data and academic records.
The Student Resource Management System (SRMS) is a web-based application developed to simplify and digitalize the management of student-related academic activities within an educational institution. In many colleges, especially in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department, maintaining and accessing student data such as attendance, marks, and study materials is still done manually. This leads to inefficiency, redundancy, and loss of valuable academic records. The SRMS aims to overcome these limitations by providing a centralized and automated platform that can be accessed securely by students and faculty members.

The system is designed using modern web technologies to ensure scalability, security, and user-friendliness. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React.js) to create an interactive and responsive user interface. The backend is implemented using Python Flask (or Node.js with Express.js) to handle data processing, routing, and communication between the client and the server. The database uses SQLite (or MySQL/MongoDB) to store structured data such as student profiles, attendance records, grades, and uploaded study materials.

The system provides separate login modules for students and faculty. Faculty members can add or update student information, upload learning materials, and manage attendance and marks, while students can view their profiles, attendance status, grades, and access uploaded study materials anytime. The platform also generates summary reports to help faculty members analyze academic performance efficiently.

This project demonstrates the application of core Computer Science concepts such as database management, web programming, client-server architecture, and software engineering principles. The SRMS not only enhances the digital transformation of academic processes but also promotes transparency and efficiency in managing student data. It can be further extended by integrating cloud storage, AI-based performance prediction, and mobile app support for a complete academic management solution.
